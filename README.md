JavaScript Pet

Do you love pets but can't have one for various reasons? Fear not, with the JavaScript Pet project, you can have your own virtual pet without any of the drawbacks of real pets. JavaScript Pets are made of code and can do literally anything, and they don't even leave a mess!
Features

The JavaScript Pet project lets you create and take care of your own virtual pet. Some of the features of the project include:

    Naming your pet: Give your virtual pet a unique name of your choice.
    Aging: Your pet will age over time, and as it gets older, it will get hungrier and less fit.
    Walking: You can take your pet for a walk to increase its fitness. The more you walk it, the fitter it will become.
    Feeding: You can feed your pet to decrease its hunger. Keep an eye on its hunger levels to make sure it doesn't get too hungry.
    Talking: You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking. Your pet will let you know if it's hungry or needs exercise.
    Death: If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will die. Also, if your pet reaches 30 days old, it will die of old age.

How to use

To use the JavaScript Pet project, simply run the program. You'll be prompted to choose a name for your pet, and then you can start taking care of it. Use the available commands to feed, walk, and talk to your pet. Make sure you keep an eye on your pet's hunger and fitness levels, so it doesn't die prematurely.
